A gentle man walked up to me to say I looked familiar and actually he looked familiar too. We exchanged contacts after the familiarization. I Did my findings from my mum and discovered our both families were close. We got talking literally every day and the restÂ Â isÂ historyðŸ¥°.`,

The two of us had never had any real connection until October 2022 when we coincidentally met at the burial of my mentor's father. I noticed her from a distance, her radiant smile caught my attention. I approached her and her mum re-introducing myself to both of them and we exchanged contact information. This marked the beginning of a heartwarming reunion. Our conversations since then have been nothing short of exhilarating and exciting,  which is the start of a journeyÂ toÂ foreverðŸ¥°.`,
